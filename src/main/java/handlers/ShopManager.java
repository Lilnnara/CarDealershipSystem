    //  The ShopManager would then handle all business logic that isn't directly related 
    // to object creation or file I/O. It's a good place to manage inventory (stock updates) 
    // and any other business operations such as processing sales and returns. 
    // For our shop, ShopManager could be responsible for:
    
    // -Managing stock levels when cars are bought or returned.
    // -Updating the CSV files after any transaction, which can be achieved by invoking FileHandler to write the updated data back to the files.
    // -Handling logging of transactions or any other events.
